title: Introducing REST
---

## Rest
A hybrid architectural style derived from several network based architectural styles. 

## Two Perspectives in Architectural design
There are 2 common perspectives in architectural design (be it building or software)
The designer 
1. starts with nothing.
   1. a blank slate, whiteboard.
   2. builds up an architecture from _familiar components_ until it satisfies the need of an intended system.
   3. emphasis on creativity and unbounded vision.
   4. used by REST
2. starts with all the system needs, 
   1. without _constraints first._
   2. incrementally identifies and applies constraints to the elements of the system.
   3. restraint and an understanding od system context.

### The Null Style
* Simple an empty set of constraints
* A system which has no distinguishable boundaries between components.
