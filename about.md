  Hi there! These pages will cover all about RESTful architecture and HTTP. Though it will be unstructured as a whole, each page will deal with a single concept of REST or HTTP, will cover it in deep and will be linked & tagged to similar concepts.

## About Restful 
* Acronym for REpresentational State Transfer.
  * REpresentation is the thing / stuff to transfer.
* It defines how Web standards like HTTP and URI are supposed to be used.

## About HTTP
* Hypertext Transfer Protocol
* Just one incarnation of REST style!
